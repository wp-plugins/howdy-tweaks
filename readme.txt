Change "Howdy" and add more links to the Favorites drop-down

== Description ==

Change the "Howdy" greeting in the upper right-hand corner, as well add more links. Also add links to the Favorites drop-down.

My favorite is "All Settings" which links to options.php.

In 3.2-beta2, you can still add links, but you cannot change "Howdy."

As the release nears, I'll see if this ability is added back, or if I need to add a JavaScript solution.
