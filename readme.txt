Change "Howdy" and add more links to the Favorites drop-down

== Description ==

Change the "Howdy" greeting in the upper right-hand corner, as well add more links. Also add links to the Favorites drop-down.

My favorite is "All Settings" which links to options.php.

The [development release](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/howdy-tweaks/developers/) supports user-specific favorites. Check it out and let me know if you find any bugs.
